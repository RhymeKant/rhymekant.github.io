			<h1>Room/Apartment Wanted</h1>
			<h2>Hi, my name is Thomas, and Lyra is my cat!</h2>
			<p align="justify">We are currently looking for a <strong>room in a shared apartment</strong> or a <strong>studio</strong> for rent or sublease, preferably in the Lakeview area or in neighboring areas, especially along the Brown or Red lines. Access to transit and/or bike trails is a huge plus.
			<br>Aiming to move around mid-February to March, though exact dates are flexible. Long-term renting would be best.
			<br>For logistical details and more information, please <a href="mailto:viewlake@protonmail.com">email</a> me at <code>viewlake@protonmail.com</code>. I can provide references upon request.</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>About me</em>: 26 years old. Chicago native. Avid reader, newbie climber, casual cyclist, expert at napping. Academic interests include ancient history, philosophy, and law.
			<br><em>As a housemate, I am</em>... quiet, an open communicator, certain to pay rent on time, fastidiously clean and organized, and respectful of boundaries. Also happy to hang out in communal spaces and socialize and be friends!</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>What about the cat</em>? Lyra, 3 years old, DSH brown/white tabby, tiny cat. Rescue cat that has been with me for about 2.5 years. Incredibly sweet and social, very friendly and comfortable with humans. Bit of a diva personalityâ€”she will sit on your lap on her own terms and you will be happy about it, hopefully.
			<br>She is probably not great with other cats, since she tends to be very dominant and playful. Might get along with a younger kitten or another active cat. She is scared of most dogs, however.</p>
			<p align="justify">If you want to help my search, or perhaps know someone who might be interested, feel free to send this QR code their way!

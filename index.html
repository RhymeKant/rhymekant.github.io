			<h1>Room/Apartment Wanted</h1>
			<h2>Hi, my name is Thomas, and Lyra is my cat!</h2>
			<p align="justify">26 y/o Chicago native seeking shared room/studio/1BR in Lakeview, Andersonville, Lincoln Park, Uptown, Ravenswood, or nearby areas with transit/bike trail access along Brown/Red lines. 
			<br>Move-in between Apr-Jun, flexible dates. Prefer long-term renting. Good credit, verifiable employment, willing to discuss budget via email. 
			
			<br>For more information, please <a href="mailto:viewlake@protonmail.com">email</a> at <code>viewlake@protonmail.com</code>. References available upon request.</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>About me</em>: I'm a 26-year-old Chicago native with academic interests in ancient history, philosophy, and law. I enjoy reading, climbing, cycling, and napping. Quiet, communicative, clean, organized, and respectful housemate who's happy to socialize.
			<p align="justify"><em>About the cat</em>: I have a 3-yr-old DSH brown/white tabby, Lyra, who's sweet, social, and friendly with humans. Lyra may not be great with other cats at first but could get along with a younger kitten or another active cat. Scared of most dogs. She has a diva personality â€” she'll sit on your lap on her own terms, but you'll be okay about it (hopefully).
			<p align="center">As promised, pictures of the one and only Lyra:

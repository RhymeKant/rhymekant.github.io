			<h1>Room/Apartment Wanted</h1>
			<h2>Hi, my name is Thomas, and Lyra is my cat!</h2>
			<p align="justify">Looking for a <strong>shared room/studio/1BR</strong> to rent/sublease in Lakeview, Andersonville, Lincoln Park, Uptown, Ravenswood, etc. or nearby areas along Brown/Red lines with transit/bike trail access.
			<br>Move-in between April to June, flexible dates. Prefer long-term renting.
			<br>I have a good credit history, verifiable employment, and am willing to discuss budget details via email.
			<br>For more information, please <a href="mailto:viewlake@protonmail.com">email</a> at <code>viewlake@protonmail.com</code>. References available upon request.</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>About me</em>: I'm a 26-year-old Chicago native with academic interests in ancient history, philosophy, and law. I enjoy reading, climbing, cycling, and napping. As a housemate, I'm quiet, communicative, reliable with rent, clean, organized, and respectful of boundaries. I'm also happy to socialize and hang out in communal spaces.
			<br><em>As a housemate, I am</em>... quiet, an open communicator, certain to pay rent on time, fastidiously clean and organized, and respectful of boundaries. Also happy to hang out in communal spaces and socialize and be friends!</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>About the cat</em>: I also have a 3-year-old DSH brown/white tabby named Lyra. She's a rescue cat and has been with me for 2.5 years. She's incredibly sweet, social, and friendly with humans. Lyra is a tiny cat with a bit of a diva personality â€” she'll sit on your lap on her own terms, but you'll be happy about it (hopefully).
			<br>Lyra tends to be dominant and playful, so she may not be great with other cats at first, but could potentially get along with a younger kitten or another active cat. She is generally scared of most dogs.</p>
			<p align="center">As promised, pictures of the one and only Lyra:

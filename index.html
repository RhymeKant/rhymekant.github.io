        		<h1>Hi there, my name is Thomas, he/him pronouns, and my cat is Lyra!</h1>
			<p>We are currently looking for a room in a shared apartment or a studio for rent or sublease, preferably somewhere along the Brown or Red lines.
			<br>Aiming to move around mid-February to March, though exact dates are flexible. Long-term renting would be best.
			<br>For logistical details and more information, click the 'email' button below to get in touch with me. I can also provide references.</p>
			<p><em>About me</em>: 26 years old. Chicago native. Avid reader, newbie climber, casual cyclist, expert at napping. Interested in ancient history, philosophy, and law. Not much of an activist, but I try to adhere to minimal waste and eco-conscious principles.
			<br><em>As a housemate, I am</em>... quiet, pay rent on time, fastidiously clean and organized, respectful of boundaries. Also excited to hang out in communal spaces and socialize!</p>
			<p><em>What about the cat?</em> Lyra, 3 years old, DSH brown/white tabby. Rescue cat that has been with me for about 2.5 years. Incredibly sweet and social, very friendly and comfortable with humans. Bit of a diva personalityâ€”she will sit on your lap on her own terms and you will be happy about it, hopefully.</p>
			<p>As promised, pictures of the one and only Lyra:
